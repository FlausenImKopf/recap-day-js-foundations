# JavaScript Coding Katas

> Created during my time [@CodingBootcampsEurope](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu).
> This repo was just for learning purposes and is not cleaned up. 

We were given three Codewars-like javascript coding tasks to solve:

- zip strings
- extract classname
- filter api data
